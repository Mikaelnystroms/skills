# Data Expert Reference Index

Use this index to load only the relevant reference file:

- `spark-sql.md`: Spark SQL/HiveQL syntax and transformation rules.
- `pyspark.md`: PySpark DataFrame patterns and anti-pattern guidance.
- `pandas.md`: pandas transformation and safety patterns.
- `polars.md`: Polars expression-first and lazy execution patterns.
- `cross-engine-checklist.md`: behavior-preservation checks across rewrites and migrations.

Keep context tight by opening a single engine file plus `cross-engine-checklist.md` when needed.
